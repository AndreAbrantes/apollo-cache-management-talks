### Let's go back for a minute 

<img src={goBack} style={{ maxHeight: 400 }} />

We need to understand how cache works on the web

</Invert>

</Layout>

---

<Layout>

# What is cache and why it's necessary?

<Steps>

- Cache data is stored on your computer or phone when you browse the internet
- Decreases the response time 
- Avoid unnecessary requests to the server
- Reduces bandwidth = Benefits the user 

</Steps>

</Layout>

<Layout>

# Client Side Cashing

<img src={clientSideCashing} style={{ height: 400 }} />

- Exists since 90's
- Via HTTP headers (Last-Modified, Cache-Control, etc)
- Control over the browser requests from the server 

<a href='https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html'>

# But dealing with cache on GraphQL isn't that easy  

<img src={difficult} style={{ height: 400 }} />

</Invert>

</Layout>

---

<Layout>

### Reasons: 

<Steps>

- GraphQL API's hits a single endpoint 
- Hard to predic the response because of the flexibity of fields 
- GraphQL clients send bodies to the server with POST method instead of GET

</Steps>

</Layout>

# But Apollo Client provides an abstraction layer to manage cache

# Cache Normalization

### AC3 uses in-memory caching, which is a normalized data store. 
### But how is the process to normalize the cache data? And what's normalization at all?

</Layout>

---

<Invert>

# Data normalization on relational databases 

### "Database normalization is the process of restructuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity."

## Customizing the unique identifier of a type 

#### AC3 provides an easy [API](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/v3.0-beta/caching/cache-configuration/#customizing-identifier-generation-by-type) to customize the unique identifier of a certain type.

<img src={keyFieldsApi} />

</Layout>

---

<Layout>

## Don't forget to fetch the unique identifiers of a type ⚠️

### By not fetching the unique identifiers of a type, the response data won't be normalized and the cache won't be correctly stored 

<img src={badExampleQuery} style={{ height: 450 }} />

#### The object's fields are merged by acessing the store with the type identifier

</Layout>

<Layout isInvert>

## Flattened Data Structure in which the normalized items are stored

---

<Layout isInvert>
<Invert>

### Since it's a flat data structure, the objects are accessible throught their unique identifiers, example:

<img src={flatStructureExample} style={{ height: 400 }}/>

</Invert>
</Layout>

<Invert>

### Besides storing the normalized objects, the queries are also stored in order to maintain the list items order

# Let's dive into cache policies in order to understand how to use the cached data

- cache-first (Default)
- cache-and-network 
- network-only 
- no-cache 

</Layout>

---

<Layout isInvert>
<Invert>

# cache-first

1. Executes the query and checks for the cached data. 
2. If the data is cached, it's going to be returned directly, avoiding the network requests. 
3. If there's no cache data, Apollo will make a network request in order to get the response data and save it on the cache.

</Invert>
</Layout>

---

<Layout>

# cache-and-network

Recommended for data that is **frequently updated**. Example: Social media applications. 
It'll always return the up-to-date data.

1. Executes the query and checks for the cached data. 
2. If the data is cached, it's going to be returned directly. 
3. Even if the data is on the cache on not, Apollo will make a network request in order to get the up-to-date data. 
4. Update the cached data by merging the response data 

</Layout>

--- 

<Layout isInvert>
<Invert>

# network-only 

This policy will **never return out-to-date data** because the network requests will always be
executed, and the data will be saved on the cache store at the same time. 

1. Executes the query and makes the network requests
2. The server responds with the data and the cache is updated 

</Invert>
</Layout>

---

<Layout>

# no-cache  

Similar to `network-only`, but it doesn't save the data on the cache.

1. Executes the query and makes the network requests
2. The server responds with the data 

</Layout>

---

## Updating the cache 
Apollo will update the cache automatically if the mutation response always return the new data with the **same type** as the query object, in order to retrieve the unique identifer and merge the cache data.

If a mutation changes a single entity and returns the value with the same type as the current query object, we don't need to worry about 
updating the cache manually. 

<img src={mutationExample} style={{ height: 400 }} />

---

## Cases when the cache is automatically updated:

- Editing a single entity and returning the same type on the response object
- Editing many entities and returning the same types on the response objects 

All the components executing the query will get re-rendered when the cache is updated

---

### Cases when the cache isn't automatically updated because the merge isn't possible:

- The response data isn't related with the query type 
- The entire set of objects isn't returned on the response data 
- The mutation doesn't return the data with the same order as the cached data 
- The mutation adds or remove items 

The cache doesn't know how the array of items should change - In these cases, we need to 
update the cache manually 

---

### Cases when the cache isn't automatically updated because the merge isn't possible:

- The response data isn't related with the query type 
- The entire set of objects isn't returned on the response data 
- The mutation doesn't return the data with the same order as the cached data 
- The mutation adds or remove items 

#### How we should deal with these cases?

# Updating the cache when adding an item 

<img src={addingItemExample} style={{ height: 550 }} />

---

# Updating the cache when deleting an item 

<img src={deletingItemExample} style={{ height: 550 }} />

---

# Type Policies 

AC3 provides an API to customize how the cache interacts with specific types, by mapping 
the ``__typename`` to ``typePolicies`` option when creating a new ``InMemoryCache`` 

<img src={typePoliciesExample} style={{ height: "50%" }}/>

---

# Field Policies - Customizing the behavior of cached fields 

We're able to customize how a particular field is read or written in the , by 
proving a `read` and `merge` options.

---

<img src={readFunctionExample} style={{ height: "50%" }}/>

<img src={mergeFunctionExample} style={{ height: "50%"}} />

---

# Pagination Helpers 

We can also use field policies to handle pagination. AC3 exports pagination helpers, as the pagination is generic and can
work for list of entities. 

<img src={paginationHelperExample} style={{ height: "50%" }} />
